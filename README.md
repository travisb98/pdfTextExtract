# pdfTextExtract


- ## Overview
  - The overall goal of this project was to develop a python script to extract data from PDFs and parse it into excel columns.


- ## Programs, Languages and tools
  - Python
  - Pymupdf


- ## Instructions
    - 0: Download the files, save them in a folder and add the subfolders "input", "output", "template_pages"
    - 1: Place your PDF files in the "Input" folder.
    - 2: Run the "CreateTemplatePages.py" script, this simply takes the first page from each PDF in the input folder and saves it to the "template pages" folder.
    - 3: Open the single-page PDF files in the "template pages" folder and add @ signs to the pdf. Add the @ signs where you think the column separations should be in the excel output
    - 4: Run the pdfTextExtract.py or pdfTextExtract.ipynb files
    - 5: Review the output in the output folder
    - 6: Profit
